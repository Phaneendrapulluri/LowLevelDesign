    /*
    “this” in Java is a keyword that refers to the current object instance.
    Using “this” reference can improve code readability and reduce naming conflicts.

    Uses -
    1. Using the ‘this’ keyword to refer to current class instance variables.
    2. Using this() to invoke current class constructor.
    3. Using ‘this’ keyword to return the current class instance
    4. Using ‘this’ keyword as a method parameter. - will pass the current object as a parameter.
    5. Using ‘this’ keyword to invoke the current class method.
    6. Using ‘this’ keyword as an argument in the constructor call.
     */
    /*
    Advantages -
    It helps to distinguish between instance variables and local variables with the same name.
    It can be used to pass the current object as an argument to another method.
    It can be used to return the current object from a method.
    It can be used to invoke a constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class.
    Disadvantages -
    Overuse of this can make the code harder to read and understand.
    Using this unnecessarily can add unnecessary overhead to the program.
    Using this in a static context results in a compile-time error.
