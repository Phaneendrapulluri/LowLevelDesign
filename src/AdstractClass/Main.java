    Java abstract class is a class that can not be initiated by itself,
        it needs to be subclassed by another class to use its properties.
    An abstract class is declared using the “abstract” keyword in its class definition.

    Child class should implement all the abstract methods of the parent abstract class.
    An instance of an abstract class can not be created.
    Constructors are allowed.
    We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.
    There can be a final method in abstract class but any abstract method in class(abstract class)
        can not be declared as final
        or in simpler terms final method can not be abstract itself
    We can define static methods in an abstract class
    We can use the abstract keyword for declaring top-level classes (Outer class)
        as well as inner classes as abstract
    If a class contains at least one abstract method then compulsory
        should declare a class as abstract
    If the Child class is unable to provide implementation to all abstract methods
        of the Parent class then we should declare that Child class as abstract
        so that the next level Child class should provide implementation
        to the remaining abstract method
